## 🌐 Connecting a Flask Application to AWS RDS (MySQL)

In this project, we’ll explore how to connect a **Flask application** to an **AWS RDS (MySQL)** database. Along the way, we’ll also manage Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances using the AWS command-line interface (CLI). By the end, we’ll have a Flask app running on EC2, fully integrated with a cloud-based MySQL database. 🚀

## Project Overview

This project walks through the steps of setting up an **AWS RDS** instance for MySQL, deploying a **Flask** application on **Amazon EC2**, and connecting the two to use RDS as the database backend. The system can be deployed and managed using the AWS CLI for greater control over cloud infrastructure. 

We’ll focus on cloud services like **EC2** for hosting the application and **RDS** for handling the database, giving the application a fully cloud-based infrastructure.

### Key Features:

- 🌐 **AWS RDS Setup**: Create and manage an Amazon RDS instance for MySQL.
- 💻 **EC2 Management**: Set up and manage an EC2 instance to host the Flask app.
- 🔗 **Flask-RDS Connection**: Connect the Flask application to the RDS database.
- 🚀 **Deployment on EC2**: Deploy the Flask app on EC2 with RDS serving as the database.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **AWS RDS (MySQL)**: For cloud-based relational database management.
- **Amazon EC2**: For hosting and deploying the Flask app.
- **Flask**: Python-based web framework for building the application.
- **AWS CLI**: To manage AWS services from the command line.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Using AWS Cloud Services
- Cloud Deployment and Management
- Distributed Application Architecture

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Manage RDS**: Set up, configure, and manage an Amazon RDS MySQL instance.
- **Deploy on EC2**: Launch and configure an EC2 instance to run a Flask application.
- **Connect Flask to RDS**: Set up the Flask app to communicate with the cloud-based MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.
